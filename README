What is Bariumsulfate?
=======================
Bariumsulfate (BaSO4) is a clean room implementation of a minecraft server
written in C++. Its main goal is giving me insight in developing, debugging and
optimizing server applications. In addition to that I expect to have fun
exploring some of the modern C++ features.

Building
========
Dependencies (tested with these versions, though lower ones may work with some
effort):
 * cmake 2.8
 * Boost 1.55
 * gcc 4.8 or clang 3.5

To compile create a build directory and invoke cmake to generate the make files.

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake /path/to/source -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    $ make

Or when building with clang on a system where gcc is the default compiler:
  
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ cmake /path/to/source \
      -D_CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=llvm- -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    $ make
